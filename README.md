npm i --save-dev @team23/eslint-config-team23-angular
```

### Usage in your project

If you've enabled `eslint` locally within your project, just set your `.eslintrc.[json|js]` config to extend the rules from this repo:

#### Extend Globally
```json
{
    "extends": "@team23/eslint-config-team23-angular"
}
```

#### Extend overrides
```json
{
    "overrides": [
        {
            "files": [
                "*.ts",
                "*.tsx"
            ],
            "extends": [
                "@team23/eslint-config-team23-angular"
            ],
            "rules": {}
        },
        {
            "files": [
                "*.html"
            ],
            "extends": [
                "@team23/eslint-config-team23-angular"
            ],
            rules: {}
        }
    ]
}
```

### Extending the .eslintrc.json

Simply add a `"rules"` key to your config, then add your overrides and additions there.

```json
{
    "extends": "@team23/eslint-config-team23-angular"
    "rules": {
        "@angular-eslint/template/no-any": "off"
    }
}
```

## Development

#### Rules that should be included here
 - angular rules (including ones that relate to templates)

#### Rules that should NOT be included here
 - eslint rules
 - @typescript-eslint rules
 - rules from other frameworks (react, vue), libraries (nx), etc.

### Proposing rule changes

For proposing changes to the ruleset please open either

-   a merge request
-   reviewed and approved by at least one mid-senior level developer
